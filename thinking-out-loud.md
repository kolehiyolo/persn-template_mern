Aight so here's what I'm supposed to do:
1. My boss wants me to be able to try out Elementor
2. I can't use Elementor for free with Wordpress.com, as it requires a paid creator account to access plugins, even if those plugins are free
3. I can, however, use Wordpress.org, to use any free plugins for actually free
4. What I'm doing now is trying to setup a Wordpress.org site locally, while trying to avoid any paid methods at all, such as having a paid domain, paid server, etc
5. Can you give me an overview of how can this be done? Give me a step by step of what exactly I need to set up this Wordpress.org site, the tools/tech I can use, and ultimately how I can get to the point where I can use free plugins, such as Elementor, on that Wordpress.org site I will create, while of course keeping in mind that no monetary costs must be incurred
